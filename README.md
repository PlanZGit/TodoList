# TodoList

IMPORTANT :

- Application stores **todos** data in **localStorage**

- **todos** data will not save if noithing is pressed

- To remove data from localStorage depends on user broswer. Inspect web browser check storage and delete.

## MVC - Model View Controller

- **Model** - Contains all code that saves and manages data
- **View** - Contains all code that manages visuals. Render visuals using data in the model
- **Control** - Connects model and veiw. Response to events from view(button clicks). Tells the model to update its data (and the view to re-render)
